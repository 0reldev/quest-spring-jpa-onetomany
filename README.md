# Quest "Spring Data JPA 2: One-to-Many"

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

This quest teaches how to create One-To-Many and Many-to-One associations in a databse with Spring Data JPA Hibernate.

A simple database of characters and schools from the Harry Potter's univers is imported. 

The purpose is to make connections with the <code>@OneToMany</code> and <code>@ManyToOne</code> Spring annotations between the `Wizard` and `School` entities.
A wizard will then be able to register to one school with the HTML forms.
